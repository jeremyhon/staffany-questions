# Testing (5 mins)

1. Explain how you could use dependency injection (or stubs or mocks) to test code. Why is this better?

2. Match the following test types to their use cases:

- Integration Testing
- Unit Testing
- UI/User Acceptance Testing
- Exploratory Testing

* Making sure a function does what it is supposed to
* Making sure a system and its associated modules work together as expected
* Making sure a feature behaves as expected
* Making sure the application/program has no subtle bugs

3. Explain black-box testing and describe a situation where it may not be as useful
